//! What two `meka` processes do to each other.
//!
//! Every other "concurrent" test in this suite is in-process: `tests/serve.rs` drives two requests
//! at one server, `tests/acp.rs` two prompts at one session. Those cannot see the properties that
//! only exist between processes -- who holds a session's file lock, which host claims a scheduled
//! occurrence, whose credential write lands last -- and an audit found several of those properties
//! were not held at all. Six tests elsewhere are *named* for cross-process behavior they
//! structurally cannot observe, and two of them enshrined the defect as intended behavior.
//!
//! So these tests spawn real `meka` binaries against one shared `MEKA_DATA_DIR`. That is slow and
//! it is the point: nothing cheaper can fail when these guarantees break.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! [`Cluster`] owns the tempdir, the `config.toml` every process reads, and the database they
//! share. Processes come from [`Cluster::meka`] (a one-shot command) and [`Cluster::serve`] (a
//! long-lived server, waited on until it logs its bind address). Assertions read the database
//! directly through `rusqlite` rather than through meka, because what is being checked is what the
//! processes *left behind*, and asking meka would ask one of the processes under test.
//!
//! Turns run through the scripted mock provider (`MEKA_MOCK_PROVIDER=1`), so nothing here reaches
//! the network or needs a credential.
