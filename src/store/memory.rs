//! The memory store: the `memories` table, its FTS5 index, and the ranked retrieval over both.
//!
//! **The table is the source of truth**, not a mirror of anything on disk. See
//! `docs/book/src/usage/memory.md` for the user-facing consequence, which is that `meka memory
//! export` replaces `grep`.
//!
//! # What SQLite holds, so this module does not
//!
//! - **The FTS index is external-content** (`content='memories'`), so three triggers keep it in
//!   step and there is no sync function to get wrong. It stays derived and disposable: `INSERT INTO
//!   memories_fts(memories_fts) VALUES('rebuild')` repairs it from the table.
//! - **`name` is `UNIQUE COLLATE NOCASE`**, which is the case-collision check.
//! - **Omit-to-keep is in the upsert**, not in a Rust branch. See [`MemoryStore::write`].
//! - **A transaction is the read-modify-write lock**, across processes, so no write door needs an
//!   `flock`. The one in-process mutex left is [`MemoryStore::lock_duplicate_check`], which guards
//!   an advisory read-then-report rather than the write.
//!
//! # Four traps
//!
//! **`bm25()` returns a negative number, and more negative is better.** [`Ranking::score`] negates
//! before multiplying by the importance weights; without that the multiplication orders the results
//! backwards, and it does so silently.
//!
//! **A model-supplied query is not FTS5 syntax.** `*`, `"`, `NEAR` and `OR` are all operators, so a
//! query containing them would either error or quietly mean something else. [`Terms`] tokenizes on
//! the Rust side and re-emits each token as a quoted string literal.
//!
//! **Never `INSERT OR REPLACE` into `memories`, and never `UPDATE` its `id`.** Both are a
//! delete-then-insert that can change the rowid, which unanchors every row of the external-content
//! index; `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` is the only upsert shape allowed here. A column added to
//! `memories` and left out of the three triggers desyncs the index just as silently, and FTS5's own
//! `integrity-check` will *not* tell you: on an external-content table it verifies the index's
//! internal structure and never compares it to the content. [`MemoryStore::integrity_check`]
//! therefore counts documents as well, [`repair_a_desynced_index`] runs that comparison at every
//! open, `meka memory verify` runs it by hand, and `rebuild_index` is the only real repair.
//!
//! **`sqlite_master.sql` is not the text you submitted.** SQLite strips `IF NOT EXISTS` and drops
//! the trailing `;`, so comparing a build's own literal against the stored one to detect drift
//! answers "drifted" every time, and the repair then runs on every process start. See
//! [`canonical_trigger_sql`].
