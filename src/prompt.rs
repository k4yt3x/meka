//! Builds the system prompt and per-turn context: permission state, environment info (PWD, date,
//! shell, OS), todo list, tool catalog, and skill summaries.
//!
//! The split between the two is a caching decision, not an organizational one. Prompt caching is
//! prefix-based and the system prompt heads that prefix, so anything rendered into it that later
//! changes re-caches the tools array and the whole conversation behind it. [`build_system_prompt`]
//! therefore takes only inputs that are fixed for a session, and everything mutable travels in the
//! per-turn `<context>` block, which is appended to the conversation like any other message.
//!
//! What lives in the block, and why each would otherwise invalidate the prefix:
//!
//! - **permission level** and the tools it blocks: `/permission` and Shift+Tab change it mid-turn.
//! - **cwd and workspace roots**: `/cd`, `--writable-root`, and an ACP client re-sending
//!   `additionalDirectories`.
//! - **todo list**: rewritten by the `todo` tool.
//! - **tools, skills, MCP server instructions** ([`WorldSnapshot`]): skills are re-read from disk
//!   every turn, MCP servers connect late and can hot-swap their tool lists.
//!
//! The last group is diffed rather than re-sent: an unchanged turn renders nothing at all.
