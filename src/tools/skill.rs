//! The `skill_*` tools: the agent's access to the installed skill store ([`crate::skills`]).
//!
//! All four gate at [`Permission::Read`], for the reason spelled out on [`crate::tools::memory`]:
//! `workspace` in meka means "may modify the user's tree", and these write to a store meka owns
//! under its own config directory. `agent_spawn` is a read-tier tool too, so the dispatcher
//! deployment these exist for runs at read permission permanently; gating them at `workspace` would
//! withhold them from the only configuration that wants them.
//!
//! `skill_write` and `skill_delete` are registered only when `[skills] agent_managed` is on, and
//! never for a sub-agent. The authorization lives in that flag rather than in the permission tier.
