//! The `context_*` tools: the agent managing its own context window.
//!
//! Deliberately a separate family from `conversation_*`, which reads the *archive* - the full
//! on-disk log, including turns compaction removed from the window entirely. These three act on the
//! live window instead. The two families sort adjacently (`cont` precedes `conv`), so the split
//! costs nothing in the catalog while keeping each name honest about what it touches.
//!
//! `context_check` exists because the pushed `[Context budget]` block
//! ([`crate::prompt::ContextBudget`]) is rendered once per turn, into the user message at turn
//! start. The counter behind it moves on every provider response including mid-tool-loop, but the
//! rendered text does not, so the gauge is stalest exactly when a tool loop is ingesting large
//! results. Refreshing the block in place would rewrite a message the cached prefix already covers
//! and invalidate it on every iteration; a tool result appends at the tail and is cache-safe by
//! construction.
