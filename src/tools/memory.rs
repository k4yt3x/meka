//! The `memory_*` tools: the agent's read/write access to its own durable notes
//! ([`crate::memory`]).
//!
//! All four gate at [`Permission::Read`], matching `scratchpad` and `todo`: these write to a store
//! meka owns in its own database, not to the user's tree, and the motivating deployment runs at
//! read permission permanently. Gating them at `workspace` would mean an agent that can never
//! remember anything, which defeats the feature.
//!
//! [`crate::memory::validate_memory_name`] is checked at every door that *writes* a name. The name
//! is not a path, so it is not a file-write primitive, but it is what `meka memory export` turns
//! into a file name and it is text the model reads in every turn's index.
//!
//! The doors that only *look a name up* -- `memory_read` and `memory_delete` -- check
//! [`crate::memory::validate_memory_lookup`] instead, which requires only that the name is not
//! empty. It bounded length too, until that turned out to re-create this same wedge one length
//! short; the cost that bound existed for is bounded in `did_you_mean_hint` now. Applying the write
//! rule to them meant a row that reached the column past the tools was listed to the model in the
//! `[Memory]` index and then refused by every door that could have opened or removed it, with `meka
//! memory export` refusing the whole store on its account.
