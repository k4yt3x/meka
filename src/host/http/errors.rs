//! RFC 9457 Problem Details for HTTP APIs. Every error response from `meka serve` uses this
//! shape, with content type `application/problem+json`. Stable `type` URIs under
//! `https://meka.so/errors/` act as machine-readable error codes that survive HTTP-status
//! collisions (multiple 404 meanings, multiple 409 meanings); see the HTTP API docs for the full
//! catalog.
//!
//! Mid-stream failures (after the SSE response has started) are emitted as an in-band
//! `turn.failed` SSE event carrying the same JSON shape; this module owns the wire type and
//! `axum` integration for the HTTP-level path.
