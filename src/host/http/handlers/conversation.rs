//! Operations that reshape or read out a session's conversation log: compaction, rewind, context
//! occupancy, and export / import.
//!
//! What the four share is that they are the HTTP surface for machinery the server already runs
//! (auto-compaction) or the CLI already exposes (`meka session export`), and that the REPL reaches
//! through `/compact`, `/rewind` and `/export`. None of them are new capability; they are the
//! missing way to ask for it over the wire.
//!
//! Compaction and rewind rewrite the conversation rather than appending to it, so on a session this
//! process holds they take its runtime mutex and refuse while a turn is in flight. Reading the DB
//! copy and writing it back would be wrong in a way that is silent: a resident session holds its
//! own `Conversation` in memory and would overwrite the change on its next turn.
//!
//! Rewind alone also has a path for a session that is *not* resident, which writes the store
//! directly instead of reviving anything, and so guards that same hazard with the on-disk
//! `lock_session` that `meka session rewind` has always used for it (`src/session/cli.rs`). That is
//! what lets a rewind reach a sub-agent's transcript, which no other operation here can.
