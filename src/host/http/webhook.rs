//! Outbound webhooks for `meka serve`.
//!
//! Everything else in the HTTP API answers a question a client asked. This is the one direction
//! that has to work when nobody is asking: a scheduled job fires at 3am and a background task
//! finishes twenty minutes after the turn that started it, and until now the only trace either left
//! was rows in SQLite that something had to poll to discover. [`crate::host::http::schedule`] has
//! said for a while that this is where a push API hooks in.
//!
//! Two decisions shape the whole module.
//!
//! **Payloads carry identifiers and metadata, never message content.** A webhook endpoint is a URL
//! in a config file: it can be mistyped, it can outlive the service that owned it, and it is
//! reachable by anything that learns it. So a delivery says *what happened to which session*, and
//! the client fetches the conversation with its own bearer token over the API it already trusts. A
//! compromised endpoint learns that a session was active, not what was said in it.
//!
//! **Delivery never blocks the work that triggered it.** Each send is a detached task with bounded
//! retries. A webhook receiver that hangs must not wedge the scheduler behind it, because the next
//! job is someone else's.
