//! The terminal between two prompts.
//!
//! meka's `[display]` spacing is described in terms of prompts, not turns: `newline_after_prompt`
//! is a blank line after the line you typed and `newline_before_prompt` one before the next prompt,
//! and both apply to *anything* printed in between. The unit is therefore an **episode**, and this
//! module owns it.
//!
//! Two rules make the shapes that break unrepresentable.
//!
//! **One owner, and it is the one that always runs.** Split ownership -- the agent opening the
//! blanks on `FrontendEvent::TurnStarted` and closing them on success, the host closing them on
//! failure -- brackets a turn that failed before it started, or a slash command that answered
//! without running a turn, once or not at all. An episode is closed by whoever is about to draw the
//! next prompt, which happens exactly once per prompt whatever went on before it.
//!
//! **An episode either prints, and gets its brackets, or it leaves no trace.** The opening blank is
//! *armed* rather than printed, and fires just before the episode's first real output, so nothing
//! can slip above it. If nothing ever prints, [`Console::close_episode`] restores the row it opened
//! on, which is what stops a scheduler wake that finds nothing to run from leaving a second prompt
//! behind.
//!
//! [`RowState`] is the fact none of the previous code tracked: a blank line only makes a gap when
//! the cursor is at column zero. Two writers park it mid-row deliberately (the thinking indicator
//! and the MCP progress line), and reedline leaves a drawn prompt behind when it breaks out for a
//! wake. Before this existed each of those was compensated for by hand at the sites someone
//! remembered, and a blank printed anywhere else was silently spent terminating the row instead.
