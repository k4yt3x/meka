//! Agent memory: durable notes the agent writes for itself, surviving compaction and outliving any
//! one session.
//!
//! Memories are rows in the `memories` table of meka's database (`MEKA_DATA_DIR`), one per note,
//! carrying a required one-line `description` and an optional body, priority and tag set. The store
//! is scoped to the meka *instance*, not to a session or a directory: meka has no Project concept,
//! and the motivating deployment is a single always-on session reachable over chat, where the agent
//! is closer to a person than to a checkout.
//!
//! This module owns the vocabulary -- what a [`Memory`] is, what names and tags are legal, how an
//! age is rendered, and how a memory is written out for `meka memory export`. Storage and retrieval
//! are [`crate::store::memory`], which is the source of truth.
//!
//! One row is the whole of a memory: there is no second copy to keep in step, and a transaction is
//! what makes a write atomic rather than a lock. `meka memory export` is the answer for anyone who
//! wants `$EDITOR`, `grep` or a git-able directory over the same content.
//!
//! [`crate::skills`] is deliberately not built this way. A `SKILL.md` is a shared spec format other
//! clients read, and a skill directory carries bundled scripts and assets, so files are right
//! there.
//!
//! Why this survives compaction: the index rides [`crate::prompt::WorldSnapshot`], which
//! `Agent::last_rendered_world` re-states in full at session start, after every compaction, and
//! whenever the previous render scrolls out of the context window.
