//! `Frontend` — the swappable driver for agent output and approval round-trips.
//!
//! `Agent::run_turn` emits its user-facing output (streamed assistant text, thinking blocks,
//! tool-call indicators, todo lists, token usage) and its tool-approval requests through `Arc<dyn
//! Frontend>` instead of calling `render::*` and `std::sync::mpsc` directly. The REPL today is one
//! impl ([`crate::repl::ReplFrontend`]); ACP, a Telegram bridge, or a web UI become additional
//! impls without touching the agent core.
//!
//! This module owns the trait, the event/permission types, and the two UI-agnostic impls
//! ([`SilentFrontend`], [`PermissionForwardingFrontend`]). Concrete UI impls live with their UI —
//! `ReplFrontend` in `crate::repl`, `AcpFrontend` in `crate::acp` — so the abstraction layer never
//! depends on a specific frontend by name.
//!
//! The event-based shape mirrors ACP's `session/update` notification — one channel for every kind
//! of agent-emitted output, discriminated by the [`FrontendEvent`] variant.

// `Mutex` is consumed only by the `#[cfg(test)] mod testing` block below — gating its import
// keeps non-test builds warning-clean now that `ReplFrontend` (the production user of
// `std::sync::Mutex`) has moved into `crate::repl`.
