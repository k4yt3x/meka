//! `HttpFrontend` — the `agsh serve` impl of [`crate::frontend::Frontend`].
//!
//! Blocking mode buffers every emitted event into the turn's recorder; mid-turn pause primitives
//! (permission approval, MCP elicitation) short-circuit to their safe defaults (`Deny`,
//! `Decline`) and append a diagnostic `Notice` so the caller can detect the misconfiguration.
//!
//! Streaming mode (`stream: true`) additionally publishes translated `SseEvent`s on a per-turn
//! `broadcast::Sender`, and the same pause primitives park on a `oneshot::Receiver` until the
//! client POSTs to `/v1/sessions/{id}/responses/{request_id}`.
//!
//! The HTTP API deliberately omits frontend-tool delegation (`delegate_fs_read` / `_fs_write` /
//! `_execute`). See the HTTP API docs — the
//! `Frontend` trait defaults already return `None`, which is the correct behaviour (the agent
//! falls back to local I/O).
