//! Scripted [`Provider`] for tests. Replays a queue of per-round `StreamEvent` lists so an
//! integration test can drive a multi-round `Agent::run_turn` (tool-use round → tool-result round →
//! final text round) without touching the network.
//!
//! Activated when `MEKA_MOCK_PROVIDER` is set to `1`, which every surface honors: `meka acp`,
//! `meka serve`, and the CLI entry point behind the REPL and `--oneshot`. That last one is what
//! lets a test ask what two `meka` processes do to each other's sessions. A second variable,
//! `MEKA_MOCK_PROVIDER_SCRIPT`, names the file holding the JSON-encoded script (see
//! [`crate::provider::mock::load_script_from_env`]). Nothing here is reachable without them, and
//! the whole module is compiled out of a release build.
//!
//! The mock is intentionally minimal: text deltas, thinking deltas, tool-use lifecycle,
//! `MessageEnd`, plus a synthetic `Fail` event that returns an error from [`Provider::stream`] so
//! the agent's non-Interrupted error path can be exercised end-to-end. Image content and
//! token-usage events are not supported; tests that need them should extend the mock first.
