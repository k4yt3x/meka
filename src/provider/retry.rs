/// on every event), so the only honest ceiling is on starting another one.

/// budget apart. A 5xx answering a completion means either "the provider cannot handle this body"
/// or "the provider is having a moment", and the agent loop cannot see which; degrading answers the
/// first, and answering the second that way destroys content on the strength of a coincidence,
/// because the degraded retry then succeeds simply because the outage ended and
/// `TurnRecovery::persist_vindicated_repair` writes the loss to the store as proven-good. The whole
/// retry sequence is only [`MAX_PROVIDER_RETRIES`] attempts across three seconds of backoff, which
/// a routine `529` burst outlasts easily, so without this the common case is the loss and the rare
/// case is the recovery.
///
/// Cheap in the case that matters and free in the case that does not: it is paid only by a turn
/// whose alternative was to start deleting things, and a payload that is genuinely broken costs one
/// wait before the degrade proceeds exactly as before.
///
/// [`BACKOFF_CAP`] rather than a number of its own, because that is already this module's answer to
