//! OpenAI Responses API encoder + SSE decoder.
//!
//! The protocol, not a backend: both [`super::responses`] (API key, any endpoint serving
//! `/v1/responses`) and [`super::subscription`] (ChatGPT's `/backend-api/codex/responses`) drive
//! this. It is the OpenAI counterpart of [`crate::provider::anthropic`]'s `shared`, and the reason
//! Chat Completions is a separate module rather than a flag: the two are different wire formats,
//! not two dialects of one.
//!
//! Nothing here may assume which endpoint is on the other end. `store: false` is set
//! unconditionally because meka replays the whole conversation every turn and never uses
//! server-side state, which also happens to be all the stateless implementations (Ollama, vLLM)
//! support. Anything that *is* endpoint-specific (the encrypted-reasoning `include`, auth
//! headers, the URL) belongs to the backend, not here.
//!
//! The on-the-wire request shape is documented at
//! <https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?api-mode=responses>. Verified against
//! the first-party Codex client:
//! - request shape: `codex-rs/codex-api/src/common.rs`
//! - input items:   `codex-rs/protocol/src/models.rs`
//! - SSE events:    `codex-rs/codex-api/src/sse/responses.rs`
