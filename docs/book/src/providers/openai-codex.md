# OpenAI Codex Provider

The `openai-codex` provider talks to OpenAI's subscription endpoint using the OAuth tokens issued by ChatGPT login. It's the OpenAI counterpart to [`claude-oauth`](./claude-oauth.md): instead of paying per-token via an API key, you authenticate with your ChatGPT Plus / Pro / Team / Business / Enterprise account and your usage counts against your subscription.

> **Note:** This provider replicates the wire shape that OpenAI's first-party [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) sends. It targets `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` using the **OpenAI Responses API**, a different protocol than [`openai-api`](./openai-api.md), which uses Chat Completions against `api.openai.com`. The two providers are not interchangeable.

## Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Profile `type` | `openai-codex` |
| Default base URL | `https://chatgpt.com` (request path `/backend-api/codex/responses`) |
| Credential | OAuth bundle stored in the database (acquired via `meka provider add` / `login`) |
| Auth method | OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE |
| OAuth issuer | `https://auth.openai.com` |
| Required tier | ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, Business, Enterprise, or Edu |

## Initial Setup

```bash
meka provider add chatgpt --type openai-codex --model gpt-5
# A browser opens; sign in to ChatGPT and approve.
# Tokens are saved to ~/.local/share/meka/meka.db (chmod 0600).
```

`meka provider add` binds a local listener on `127.0.0.1:1455` to receive the OAuth callback, matching the redirect URI registered with OpenAI's auth server. If port 1455 is already in use (e.g. you're already running the Codex CLI), free it first.

## Config File

`meka provider add` writes this for you (the token bundle stays in the database):

```toml
default_provider = "chatgpt"

[providers.chatgpt]
type = "openai-codex"
model = "gpt-5"
effort = "high"   # optional; "low" | "medium" | "high"
```

The `effort` field maps to the Responses API `reasoning.effort` knob and is only consumed by reasoning-capable models (gpt-5, o-series). It defaults to `"high"`.

## Supported Models

Whatever your ChatGPT subscription tier exposes: typically `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-codex`, `o3`, `o4-mini`, etc. The model field on the request body is forwarded verbatim; meka doesn't gate which model strings are valid.

## How It Works

Each request:

1. **Auth header set**: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`, `ChatGPT-Account-ID: <workspace_id>` (extracted from the JWT id_token at login), `originator: meka_cli`, plus a `User-Agent` identifying meka.
2. **Cookie jar enabled**: `chatgpt.com` is fronted by Cloudflare; bot-clearance cookies (`__cf_bm` etc.) persist across requests automatically.
3. **Body**: standard Responses API JSON: `instructions`, `input` (an array of `message` / `function_call` / `function_call_output` items), `tools`, optional `reasoning.effort`.
4. **Stream**: SSE events: `response.output_text.delta` for text, `response.output_item.added` / `…done` for tool calls, `response.reasoning_text.delta` for thinking, `response.completed` for end-of-turn with token usage.
5. **Token refresh**: when the access token is within 5 minutes of expiry, meka transparently refreshes it against `auth.openai.com/oauth/token` before the next request.

## Limitations

- **Streaming-only**: the Codex endpoint doesn't support non-streaming completions. meka always streams for this provider; `--no-stream` is rejected with an explicit error.
- **Subscription required**: you need a paid ChatGPT plan with Codex enabled. Free-tier accounts can complete the OAuth flow but most models will reject requests at the API layer.
- **Bot detection**: chatgpt.com may serve a Cloudflare challenge if request patterns look automated. meka's reqwest client handles cookie-clearance automatically; if you hit a hard challenge, complete it once in a regular browser to refresh the cookies.
- **Endpoint stability**: this is OpenAI's subscription-internal API; OpenAI doesn't guarantee compatibility for third-party clients. Future Codex versions could add request signing or rotate scopes; meka will need updates if that happens.

## Subscription vs API Key

If you have both a ChatGPT subscription and an OpenAI API key:

- Use **`openai-codex`** for interactive work: it's billed against your subscription's usage cap rather than per-token, so heavy use is cheaper for most personal patterns.
- Use **`openai-api`** for scripted / unattended work: API keys are stable, work with non-OpenAI Chat-Completions-compatible servers (Ollama, vLLM, OpenRouter), and don't depend on the Cloudflare cookie jar.

## Logging Out

`meka provider remove <name>` revokes the OAuth token (best-effort), deletes the stored credential
from the database, and removes the profile from the config file:

```bash
meka provider remove chatgpt
```

To re-authenticate the same profile without removing it (e.g. after a dead refresh token), run
`meka provider login <name>` for a fresh PKCE pair.
