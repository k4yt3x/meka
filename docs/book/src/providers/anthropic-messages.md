# Anthropic Messages

The **Anthropic Messages API** (`POST {base_url}/v1/messages`) with an API key. Use this when you have an Anthropic API key, billed per token; to bill a Claude subscription instead, see [`claude-subscription`](./claude-subscription.md), which speaks the same protocol.

The protocol is not Anthropic's alone. Databricks, OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, LiteLLM, Synthetic and Ollama all serve `/v1/messages`, as does Amazon Bedrock on its Anthropic-compatible host (`https://bedrock-mantle.{region}.api.aws/anthropic`, with an API key, *not* `bedrock-runtime`, which is SigV4 and `/model/{id}/invoke`). This backend reaches any of them via `base_url`, which is why it is named for the protocol rather than for Claude.

## Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Account `backend` | `anthropic-messages` |
| Default base URL | `https://api.anthropic.com` |
| Credential | API key (`sk-ant-api03-...`) kept in the store |
| Auth method | `x-api-key` header |
| API version | `2023-06-01` |

### Quickest start

```bash
meka account add anthropic --backend anthropic-messages
meka profile add work --account anthropic --model claude-opus-5
```

`meka account add` prompts for your Claude API key, saves it to the store, and writes the
`[accounts.anthropic]` table. To read the key from a pipe instead of prompting, pass
`--api-key-stdin`. `meka profile add` then writes the profile that names the model.

### Config file

The two commands write this for you (the key stays in the store, not here):

```toml
default_profile = "work"

[accounts.anthropic]
backend = "anthropic-messages"

[profiles.work]
account = "anthropic"
model   = "claude-opus-5"
```

### `effort`

meka sends the reasoning-effort control as `output_config.effort` in the request body. Unlike `claude-subscription`, no beta header is needed: the parameter is generally available on the direct Messages API. When `effort` is unset the field is omitted entirely, which is how you ask for Anthropic's own default. See the [`effort`](../configuration/config-file.md#effort) config reference for the levels.

### `thinking`

`adaptive` (the default) sends `thinking: {"type": "adaptive"}` and lets the model set its own budget; `budgeted` sends the older `{"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}` form, taking N from the profile's `thinking_budget` and falling back to [`[thinking].budget`](../configuration/config-file.md#thinkingbudget); `off` sends no thinking field. Pre-4.6 Claude models require `budgeted`.

## Supported models

Any model available through the Claude Messages API; meka forwards the model string verbatim and doesn't gate which strings are valid. For the current line-up and their retirement dates, see [Anthropic's models overview](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview); `meka profile add` suggests `claude-opus-5` for a profile on a Claude account.

## Custom base URL

To use a Claude-API-compatible proxy or gateway, set the account's `base_url` when creating it:

```bash
meka account add gateway --backend anthropic-messages \
    --base-url https://gateway.example.com/anthropic
meka profile add gateway --account gateway --model claude-opus-5
```

A trailing `/v1` is dropped, since meka appends it per request: publish `https://gateway.example.com/anthropic` or `https://gateway.example.com/anthropic/v1`, either works.

### Anthropic-compatible endpoints

The model behind the endpoint doesn't have to be Claude. Ollama, LM Studio and similar runtimes serve local weights over `POST /v1/messages`, and `anthropic-messages` reaches them with a placeholder key:

```bash
meka account add local --backend anthropic-messages --base-url http://127.0.0.1:11434
meka profile add local --account local --model 'hf.co/bartowski/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF:Q8_0'
```

Nothing in the request is tuned to Claude unless you ask for it. `effort` is omitted when unset, so a backend with no reasoning tiers is never handed one, and `thinking` is whatever the profile says rather than something inferred from the model name: set `budgeted` if your endpoint only implements the older encoding, or `off` if it implements neither.

The one setting worth stating is the context window. meka never probes for it, so an unset profile budgets against the 1M default; on a smaller model that means compaction only fires once the backend itself rejects the request:

```toml
[profiles.local]
context_window = 262144
thinking = "budgeted"   # only if the endpoint rejects the adaptive form
```

## API details

**Endpoint:** `POST {base_url}/v1/messages`

**Headers:**
- `x-api-key: <api_key>`
- `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`
- `content-type: application/json`
- `accept: application/json`
- `anthropic-beta: interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14`, whenever thinking is on (the default)

**System prompt:** Sent as a top-level `system` string.

**Tool format:** Tools are defined with `input_schema`:

```json
{

  "description": "Read the contents of a file at the given path.",
  "input_schema": { "type": "object", "properties": { ... } }
}
```

**Streaming:** Server-Sent Events with named event types (`message_start`, `content_block_start`, `content_block_delta`, `content_block_stop`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`, `ping`).
