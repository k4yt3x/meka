# Scratchpad

The scratchpad is a session-scoped working memory that the agent can use to store, retrieve, edit, and manage content without consuming conversation context. Entries are identified by string names and persist across turns within a session.

## When the scratchpad is used

- **Proactively**: The agent stores intermediate results (extracted text, API responses, research notes) for later use.
- **Via `scratchpad` parameter**: any tool call carrying one has its output saved there instead of returned inline. See [Scratchpad parameter](./overview.md#scratchpad-parameter) for which tools advertise it.
- **Automatically**: when a tool's output exceeds 30,000 bytes, it is saved under a generated name (e.g. `execute_command_a1b2c3_1`) and replaced with a preview. Reading the entry back is never treated that way: a `scratchpad_read` reply stays inline however large, sized to what fits in the context window (see `limit` below).

## Tools

The whole family ships default-active; no `load_tool` round-trip is required to use any of them.

### `scratchpad_write`

Store content in the scratchpad. If the name already exists, the content is overwritten.

**Permission:** Read

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | Name for the entry |
| `content` | string | yes | The content to store |

### `scratchpad_read`

Read or search a scratchpad entry by name.

**Permission:** Read

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | The entry name |
| `offset` | integer | no | Byte offset to start reading from (default: 0) |
| `limit` | integer | no | Maximum bytes to return. Pass the entry's `size` to load all content in one call; a read that would carry the context past the `context_ceiling_percent` line is cut there, whether or not `auto_compact` is on, and the reply names the offset to continue from. The cut is sized by a token bound that errs toward cutting: letters count about five to a token, every digit, symbol and non-ASCII character counts as one, so dense text such as numbers, hashes or JSON is cut sooner than prose. A read never returns less than the 30,000 bytes any tool may return inline. (Default and exact value are advertised in the tool's parameter schema.) |
| `regex` | string | no | Search the entry and return matching lines (capped, exact value advertised in the tool's parameter schema). |

### `scratchpad_edit`

Edit a scratchpad entry in place. Provide `content` for a full overwrite, or `old_string`/`new_string` for targeted replacement.

**Permission:** Read

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | The entry name |
| `content` | string | no | Full replacement (mutually exclusive with old/new) |
| `old_string` | string | no | String to find |
| `new_string` | string | no | Replacement string |
| `replace_all` | boolean | no | Replace all occurrences (default: false) |

### `scratchpad_list`

List all scratchpad entries as a table with `Name`, `Size`, `Created` and `Origin` columns, the last `own` for an entry this session wrote and `inherited` for one a parent lent a sub-agent read-only. No parameters.

**Permission:** Read

### `scratchpad_delete`

Delete a scratchpad entry by name.

**Permission:** Read

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | The entry name to delete |

### `scratchpad_merge`

Combine several entries into one without routing the bytes through the conversation. Useful for
collecting parallel sub-agent reports. The entries go in the order given: `sources` first, as
listed, then every own entry whose name starts with `prefix`, in name order. The sources are kept
as they are; nothing is deleted, and `target` is overwritten if it exists. A sub-agent cannot merge
into a name it inherited read-only from its parent, though it may name such an entry in `sources`;
`prefix` selects only its own entries.

**Permission:** Read

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `sources` | array of string | no | Entry names to combine, in this order; optional when `prefix` is given |
| `prefix` | string | no | Also combine every own entry whose name starts with this, in name order, after `sources`; `target` itself is never selected |
| `target` | string | yes | Name to store the result under; overwrites if it exists |
| `format` | string | no | `concat_with_headers` (default) puts a `--- name ---` line before each entry's content, `concat` joins the contents with a newline, `json_array` parses each content as JSON (quoting one that is not) into one compact array |

### `scratchpad_rename`

Rename an entry without round-tripping its content through the conversation. Errors if `old` does
not exist, if `new` already exists, or, for a sub-agent, if either name is inherited read-only.

**Permission:** Read

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `old` | string | yes | Current entry name |
| `new` | string | yes | Replacement entry name |

### `scratchpad_load_file`

Read a file's contents into a scratchpad entry without the bytes passing through the conversation.
The model never sees the payload, which is what makes this the way to stage a large log or document
for `inherit_scratchpad`. UTF-8 text only; a binary file is refused with its detected MIME type.
Overwrites an existing entry of the same name, and a sub-agent cannot load into a name it inherited
read-only from its parent.

**Permission:** Read

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | yes | The file path to read |
| `name` | string | yes | Name to store the contents under |

### `scratchpad_save_file`

Write a scratchpad entry out to a file, again without routing the bytes through the conversation.
A sub-agent can save an entry it inherited, so a sub-agent's report reaches disk without being copied
through the model.

**Permission:** Workspace

This is the one scratchpad tool that leaves meka's own storage, so it is the one that requires a
level that can write. It reads as the scratchpad's `write_file` and is fenced identically: at
`workspace` the path must resolve inside a workspace root, and the refusal is the same one
`write_file` gives. Every other scratchpad tool stays at `read` because the scratchpad lives in
the store, not your tree.

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | yes | The scratchpad entry to read from |
| `path` | string | yes | The file path to write to |
| `force` | boolean | no | Proceed despite the file already existing, or existing but being unreadable (default: false) |

## Handing entries to a sub-agent

`agent_spawn`'s `inherit_scratchpad` takes a list of the parent's entry names and grants the
sub-agent read-only access to exactly those:

```text
agent_spawn(prompt: "summarize the failures", inherit_scratchpad: ["build_log"])
```

The sub-agent's `scratchpad_read` falls back to the parent for an inherited name, and its
`scratchpad_list` shows the entry with origin `inherited`. `scratchpad_write`, `scratchpad_edit` and
`scratchpad_delete` targeting one return an error, so a sub-agent cannot rewrite what it was lent.

This is how a large captured output reaches a sub-agent without being re-inlined into the prompt.
When you expect to delegate a result later, name it at the source with the `scratchpad` parameter
(`execute_command({command: "...", scratchpad: "build_log"})`) so there is a semantic name to pass
through.

## Lifecycle

- Entries are scoped to the session and persist across turns.
- Entries survive session compaction (`/compact`).
- Entries are deleted when the session is deleted.
- Two sessions can have entries with the same name without conflict.
- Writing to an existing name overwrites it silently.
