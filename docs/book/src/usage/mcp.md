# MCP

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is how meka reaches tools, resources
and prompts it does not implement itself. A server is a process meka spawns or an HTTP endpoint it
connects to; what it advertises is registered alongside the built-in tools and called the same way.

This page covers running servers: the command suite, where their secrets live, what happens on the
wire, and what the agent can reach. The keys themselves are in the
[config file reference](../configuration/config-file.md#mcp), which is also where tool permissions
are resolved.

## `meka mcp` CLI

Manage configured servers without editing `config.toml` by hand:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `meka mcp list [--format json]` | Print all configured servers, plus any stored OAuth credential that no server claims (see [Leftover credentials](../configuration/config-file.md#leftover-credentials)). Under `json`, `{"servers": [...]}` with each server's `name`, `transport`, `required`, `disabled`, and its `permission`, `command`, `args` or `url` where set. |
| `meka mcp get <name> [--format json]` | Print full details for one server: the listing's fields plus `env_keys`, `header_keys`, the kinds of `credentials` stored (never their values), `credential_origin`, `auth`, `allowed_tools`, `disabled_tools` and `tool_permissions`. |
| `meka mcp add <name> <url-or-command> [args...] [flags]` | Persist a server. Transport is auto-detected: a URL starting with `http[s]://` means HTTP, anything else means stdio. Preserves existing formatting/comments via `toml_edit`. |
| `meka mcp remove <name>` | Best-effort revoke stored OAuth tokens (RFC 7009) at the provider, then delete the server entry, clear stored credentials, and drop any resource-update ledger entries. A name with stored credentials but no config entry is cleaned rather than refused. |
| `meka mcp disable <name>` | Set `disabled = true` on the server entry. The next `meka` start skips it entirely. |
| `meka mcp enable <name>` | Clear the `disabled` flag, so the server connects on the next start. |
| `meka mcp reconnect <name>` | Smoke-test a connect; prints `ok` or the error. |
| `meka mcp tools <name> [--format json]` | Connect and list every advertised tool with its resolved permission, the chain step that decided it, and whether the current config allows it. Useful for populating `--allow-tool`, `--disable-tool`, or `--tool-permission` overrides without leaving the CLI. Under `json`, the object `GET /v1/mcp/{name}/tools` answers with (`server`, `tools[]` of `raw_name`, `description`, `required_permission`, `permission_source`, `allowed`) plus `read_only_hint_declined`. |
| `meka mcp login <name>` | Drive interactive OAuth. If the server has no `[auth]` block and uses HTTP, assumes `type = "oauth"` and persists the block on success. With `--auth-token-stdin` or `--client-secret-stdin`, stores that secret and exits instead, which is also how you rotate one. |
| `meka mcp logout <name>` | Call the provider's `revocation_endpoint` (RFC 7009) best-effort, then clear every stored credential for the server. |

### Credentials

An MCP server's bearer token, OAuth client secret and OAuth token bundle are kept in the store (`mcp_credentials`, keyed by server name and kind), never in `config.toml`. This is the same rule accounts follow, and for the same reason: `config.toml` is a plaintext file people commit, sync and share.

Each is read from stdin so it never reaches `ps` output or your shell history. One command reads one secret, so `--auth-token-stdin` and `--client-secret-stdin` cannot be combined:

```console
$ pass show notion-token | meka mcp add notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp --auth-token-stdin
$ pass show acme-secret | meka mcp login acme --client-secret-stdin
```

A confidential OAuth client holds two at once: the long-lived client secret it authenticates with, and the refreshable bundle it obtained. Store the secret first, then run `meka mcp login <name>` to complete the flow. Refreshing the bundle leaves the client secret alone.

`meka mcp get <name>` lists which kinds a server has, without printing any of them, and shows the origin an OAuth bundle was issued for as `issued for: <scheme>://<host>[:port]`. That flags the case a rotated `url` leaves behind: a bundle minted against the old host is still stored and still sent, so the line names a mismatch rather than letting the next call fail as a bare `401`. `meka mcp list` names servers that have a stored credential but no `[[mcp.servers]]` entry, which is what a hand-edited config strands.

### `meka mcp add` flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--transport <TRANSPORT>` | Force the transport, `stdio` or `http`; auto-detected otherwise. |
| `--env <KEY=VALUE>` | Environment variable for stdio (repeatable). |
| `--header <KEY=VALUE>` | HTTP header (repeatable). |
| `--auth <AUTH>` | Configure the `[auth]` block: `oauth`, `client_credentials` or `client_credentials_jwt`. |
| `--auth-token-stdin` | Read a static bearer token from stdin and store it. Mutually exclusive with `--auth`. |
| `--client-secret-stdin` | Read an OAuth client secret from stdin and store it. Required by `--auth client_credentials`. |
| `--client-id <CLIENT_ID>` | OAuth or client_credentials client id. Not a secret, so it goes in `config.toml`. |
| `--signing-key <SIGNING_KEY>`, `--signing-algorithm <SIGNING_ALGORITHM>` | JWT signing key path and algorithm (`RS256`, `RS384`, `RS512`, `ES256`, `ES384`), `client_credentials_jwt` only. |
| `--scope <SCOPE>` | OAuth scope (repeatable). |
| `--redirect-port <REDIRECT_PORT>` | Fixed OAuth redirect port (default: ephemeral). |
| `--permission <LEVEL>` | Per-server permission cap, applied to every tool on the server: `none`, `read`, `workspace` or `unrestricted` (default: `read`). |
| `--allow-tool <TOOL>` | Raw tool name to allow (repeatable). When set, only listed tools register. |
| `--disable-tool <TOOL>` | Raw tool name to block (repeatable). Applied after `--allow-tool`. |
| `--eager-load-tool <TOOL>` | Raw tool name to eager-load (repeatable). Listed tools skip the `load_tool` round-trip and ship in the cacheable tools-array prefix from turn 1. |
| `--tool-permission <TOOL=LEVEL>` | Per-tool permission override (repeatable). `LEVEL` is `none`, `read`, `workspace` or `unrestricted`. |
| `--no-login` | Skip the auto-login an HTTP server's probe would otherwise start; run `meka mcp login <name>` later. |
| `--required` | Persist `required = true`, so a turn is refused while this server is not connected. Omitted, the server inherits `[mcp].default_required` and is optional by default. |
| `--disabled` | Persist `disabled = true`, so the server is skipped entirely at startup. Re-enable with `meka mcp enable <name>`. |

### Example: Notion

These signposts are `info` logs, so they need `-v`; at the default `warn` level the command
succeeds silently and the exit code carries the result. Timestamps and targets are elided here.

```console
$ meka -v mcp add notion https://mcp.notion.com/mcp
added 'notion' to ~/.config/meka/config.toml
probe: 'notion' requires OAuth
running OAuth authorization for 'notion' (use --no-login to skip)
no [auth] block for 'notion'; assuming OAuth authorization_code
…
authorized 'notion'
```

`meka mcp add` on an HTTP endpoint:

1. **Probe**: issues an unauthenticated `GET` (3 s timeout, redirects off) and classifies the response per the MCP authorization spec + RFC 6750 + RFC 9728:

   - `2xx` → server is open, no login needed.
   - `401` / `403` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer …` → OAuth required. The `resource_metadata="…"` attribute (RFC 9728) is captured at DEBUG.
   - Any other status → couldn't infer, prints the status code.
   - Network failure → prints the error.

2. **Auto-login**: if the probe says OAuth is required (or `--auth oauth` was explicitly set), the OAuth authorization_code flow runs immediately as though the user had chained `meka mcp login <name>` themselves. The synthesized `[auth] = oauth` block is written back to `config.toml` on success.

3. **Rollback on failure**: if the OAuth flow errors out, the entry we just wrote is purged from `config.toml` (alongside any partial credentials), leaving the user's config clean. The command exits non-zero.

4. **`--no-login`**: skips step 2. The entry is still persisted and the probe's hint is still printed; run `meka mcp login <name>` when ready. Useful for scripted setup or when you expect to edit `[auth]` by hand.

The probe and the auto-login only run for HTTP servers, and only when the user didn't provide `--auth-token-stdin` (static bearer) or `--auth` (other than `oauth`). Stdio servers skip both.

Only `meka mcp login` runs the browser flow. A host that connects a server and finds no stored credential (the REPL at startup, `meka serve`, `meka acp`, `/mcp reconnect`) marks it failed and names `meka mcp login <name>` as the remedy, rather than printing a URL to a terminal nobody may be watching.

### Remote hosts / SSH sessions

The OAuth flow redirects the browser to `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/callback`. When meka is running on a different host than the browser (SSH session, container, Codespace, WSL), the browser can't reach back and shows a "connection refused" error page. meka handles this automatically:

- While `meka mcp login <name>` waits for the callback it also watches stdin.
- The browser's address bar still contains the full callback URL (including `code` and `state`) even when the connection fails. Copy it, paste it into the meka prompt, and press Enter.
- Whichever completes first, the TCP callback or the pasted URL, wins.

meka prints the URL exactly once and leaves opening it to you, so the flow is the same on a desktop
and over SSH. The `authorized` line is an `info` log, shown here with `-v`.

```console
$ meka -v mcp login notion
open this URL in your browser to authorize:

https://mcp.notion.com/authorize?response_type=code&…

waiting up to 120s for the callback, or paste the callback URL here and press Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:46437/callback?code=…&state=…     ← paste here
authorized 'notion'
```

### REPL parity

Inside the REPL:
- `/mcp list` (or a bare `/mcp`): list configured servers.
- `/mcp reconnect <server>`: reconnect smoke-test.
- `/mcp login <server>` / `/mcp logout <server>`: run the auth flow or revoke.
- `/mcp <server>:<prompt> [args...]`: render a server-defined prompt as the next user turn.

## Resources and prompts

In addition to tools, meka exposes MCP resources and prompts through several builtin tools (deferred: the agent calls `load_tool` first to fetch the schema, then invokes them):

| Builtin | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mcp_resource_list` | List resources from one or every configured server. |
| `mcp_resource_read` | Read a resource by `server` + `uri`; text inline, binary base64-encoded. |
| `mcp_prompt_list` | List prompts from one or every configured server, including their declared arguments. |
| `mcp_prompt_get` | Render a prompt by `server` + `name` with optional `arguments`; returns `<role>: <text>` lines. |
| `mcp_resource_subscribe` | Subscribe to `resources/updated` notifications for a specific URI. |
| `mcp_resource_unsubscribe` | Cancel a prior subscription. |
| `mcp_resource_updates_list` | Print every resource that has been reported as updated since the session started. |

## Startup concurrency

MCP servers connect in parallel at startup, partitioned by transport so a fleet of stdio servers (process-spawn bound) doesn't fight a fleet of HTTP servers (network bound):

- stdio: [`[mcp].stdio_concurrency`](../configuration/config-file.md#mcp-top-level-table) (default `3`)
- http: [`[mcp].http_concurrency`](../configuration/config-file.md#mcp-top-level-table) (default `20`)

Both are tuning knobs: rarely needed, but useful if you're running ~30 stdio servers on a constrained box (lower it) or ~50 HTTP servers (raise it). `0` is refused at startup.

## Connection lifecycle

- **Reconnection** is automatic for all transports (stdio, plain HTTP, OAuth-authenticated HTTP) when the transport closes mid-session. HTTP transports use exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, capped 30s, max 5 attempts); stdio gets one immediate retry. The reconnect runs on a blocking thread to work around an upstream rmcp bug where the auth future is `!Send`.
- **Failed initial connect** is retried in the background with its own backoff (5s doubling to a 5 minute ceiling) until the server comes up, and the server's tools are registered into every live session when it does. A server that is slow to boot, or that starts after meka, therefore recovers on its own rather than staying `failed` for the life of the process. This matters most for a `required` server, where every turn is refused until it connects.
- **Session-expired recovery**: rmcp transparently re-initializes HTTP sessions on 404 / JSON-RPC `-32001`. meka relies on this; no per-call handling is required.
- **Cancellation**: when the agent cancels a tool call (e.g. Ctrl-C), meka sends `notifications/cancelled` to the server with the in-flight request id so the server can stop work.
- **Timeouts**: tool calls default to 10 minutes; override with `MEKA_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`, a duration such as `20m`.
- **Tool list refresh**: on `tools/list_changed`, meka re-discovers the server's tools and hot-swaps them in the registry; no restart needed.
- **Progress notifications**: MCP tool calls attach a per-request `progressToken`; incoming `notifications/progress` render as a live status line under the tool invocation.
- **Call identity**: `tools/call` carries two extra keys in `_meta` alongside the progress token. `meka/sessionId` is the id (a UUID) of the session the call came from, letting a server scope per-session state (a cache, a workspace, an audit trail) to one conversation; a sub-agent reports its own child session id. `meka/toolUseId` is the provider's tool-use id for the call. Both are absent for calls made outside a session, such as connection-time handshakes.
- **Server instructions**: `InitializeResult.instructions` is captured once per connection and delivered in the per-turn context (sanitized and truncated to 2048 chars) under `[MCP server instructions]`. A server that connects late, or reconnects with different instructions, is announced as a change rather than rewriting anything already sent.
- **stdio server logs**: a stdio server's own stderr (many servers log there) is captured, not inherited, so it never corrupts the REPL display. Each line is re-emitted on meka's `tracing` stream at `debug` level tagged with the server name, so it stays silent at default verbosity and surfaces under `-v` / `RUST_LOG`.
- `resources/list_changed`, `prompts/list_changed`, and `resources/updated` notifications are logged at `info`/`debug` level.

## Server-to-client features

| Feature | meka behavior |
|---------|----------------|
| `elicitation/create` | Routed to the calling session's frontend (REPL / ACP form or URL prompt) with a 60s timeout. Auto-declines when no in-flight tool call's frontend is registered or the user doesn't answer in time. |
